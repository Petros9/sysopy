[REAL_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.010000s
[USER_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s
[SYSTEM_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s

Porównanie bardzo podobnych plików (i utworzenie talbicy):

REAL_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.010000s
[USER_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s
[SYSTEM_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s

Podobnie jak wyżej dla dwóch kompletnie róznych plików:

[REAL_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.020000s
[USER_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s
[SYSTEM_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s


Dla wszystkich trzech plikow:

[REAL_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.030000s
[USER_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s
[SYSTEM_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s


Automatycznie:

[piotrswiderski@localhost moze]$ ./main initialise_array 1 make_pairs a.txt:b.txt 
[REAL_TIME] Executing action initialise_array took 0.000000s
[USER_TIME] Executing action initialise_array took 0.000000s
[SYSTEM_TIME] Executing action initialise_array took 0.000000s
[REAL_TIME] Executing action make_pairs took 0.020000s
[USER_TIME] Executing action make_pairs took 0.000000s
[SYSTEM_TIME] Executing action make_pairs took 0.000000s
[REAL_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.020000s
[USER_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s
[SYSTEM_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s
[piotrswiderski@localhost moze]$ ./main initialise_array 2 make_pairs "a.txt:b.txt c.txt cprim.txt"
[REAL_TIME] Executing action initialise_array took 0.000000s
[USER_TIME] Executing action initialise_array took 0.000000s
[SYSTEM_TIME] Executing action initialise_array took 0.000000s
[REAL_TIME] Executing action make_pairs took 0.020000s
[USER_TIME] Executing action make_pairs took 0.000000s
[SYSTEM_TIME] Executing action make_pairs took 0.000000s
[REAL_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.020000s
[USER_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s
[SYSTEM_TIME] Executing main.c took 0.000000s
